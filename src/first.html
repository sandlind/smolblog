You are now running your own blog.<br><br>
First, find <b>index.php</b> and change some configurations to personalize your blog. It is <b>extremely important</b> that you change the <b>admin password</b>. Use your new password to login as admin. You can compose and delete posts there.<br><br>

The newest post will show up on the home page. Your readers can click through your previous posts on the navigation.<br><br>

If you want to use MySQL instead of sqlite, simply change the PDO connection stuff in the config. Make sure you have the <i>posts</i> table made with columns: post_id (num), post_title (text), post_text (text), post_time (num).<br><br>
